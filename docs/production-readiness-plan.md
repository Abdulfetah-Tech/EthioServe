# Production-readiness plan

## Phase 1 assessment — 2026-10-30

EthioServe is a modular monolith with a clean ASP.NET Core 10 backend (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API and Tests) and an Angular 22 standalone-component frontend. PostgreSQL is the system of record. The architecture is appropriate for the current marketplace scope; splitting it into microservices would add deployment and operational cost without a demonstrated need.

### Verified baseline

- Backend Release build succeeds with zero warnings and errors.
- Frontend production build succeeds.
- Frontend unit tests: 374 passing.
- Backend unit, architecture and schema tests: 416 passing when Docker is available.
- Backend integration tests use Testcontainers and require Docker Desktop or a compatible Docker daemon.

### Delivered capabilities

- JWT authentication, rotating hashed refresh tokens, lockout, password reset, rate limiting, role enforcement, RFC 7807 errors and structured logging.
- Public provider discovery with service and location filtering; provider self-service; provider review and verification by administrators.
- Customer request lifecycle, safe image attachments, provider quotations, appointment scheduling, notifications and authenticated SignalR notification delivery.
- EF Core migrations, database constraints, optimistic concurrency and audit records for sensitive actions.
- Dockerfiles, Compose health checks, GitHub Actions and broad unit/integration coverage.

### Prioritized gaps

1. **Deployment correctness (in progress):** Compose now supplies the required JWT signing key, initializes an empty database and forwards `/api` and `/hubs` to the private API container. A full container startup check remains.
2. **Operations:** document production environment variables, migrations, backups, AWS ECS/Fargate/RDS topology, secrets management, logs and TLS termination.
3. **Marketplace completeness:** completed-job reviews now have customer submission, public display, rating aggregation, notification, ownership checks and audit coverage. Real payment providers, direct customer-provider messaging, favorites, portfolios, review moderation UI and a configurable availability calendar are not complete product flows.
4. **Authentication hardening:** add verified-email and optional MFA design, asynchronous transactional email, and retention/cleanup for expired reset and refresh tokens.
5. **Observability:** define structured operational events, health/readiness probes for deployed infrastructure and alerting dashboards.

## Implementation checklist

- [x] Preserve clean working tree and establish build/test baseline.
- [x] Confirm no committed `.env` file and avoid exposing local secrets.
- [x] Repair Compose secret contract, first-run database initialization, and frontend API/SignalR proxying.
- [x] Keep generated frontend artifacts out of the container build context.
- [ ] Validate a complete Compose startup plus browser-to-API and SignalR path.
- [ ] Add production/AWS deployment runbook.
- [ ] Implement the next complete marketplace workflow, beginning with reviews after confirming its intended moderation rules.
- [x] Implement the completed-job review workflow through API, UI, notifications and automated tests.
- [ ] Add workflow-level integration and frontend coverage for each new capability.
